# Realtime_cloud_native_monitoring_app

Welcome to the Realtime DevOps Project! I have taken the initiative to develop a hands-on, cloud-native application project that showcases my expertise in  various DevOps tools, including AWS, Python, Docker, and Kubernetes. This projectshowcases my  skills in creating a Python monitoring application, containerization, image management, and Kubernetes deployment.


Project Overview
In this project,I have created:

Python Monitoring Application: A Python monitoring application using Flask, demonstrating my ability to build applications from the ground up.

Local Application Deployment: How to run the Python application locally on port 5000, ensuring it works seamlessly.

Containerization with Docker:I have containerized the Python application, highlighting my proficiency in containerization technologies.

Dockerfile Creation: I have provided a clear and concise Dockerfile, showcasing my expertise in writing containerization instructions.

Building Docker Image: Building a Docker image from the Dockerfile exemplifies your skills in image management and distribution.

Running Docker Container: I have demonstrated how to deploy the Python application by running a Docker container from the Docker image, emphasizing my practical knowledge.

ECR Image Repository: I have established an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and pushed the Docker image to the repository, showcasing my ability to manage container images.

EKS Cluster and Nodes: My expertise in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is evident through the creation of a cluster with nodes, setting up the environment for Kubernetes deployment.

Kubernetes Deployment: I have led the way in creating Kubernetes Deployments and Services using Python, managing the application within a Kubernetes cluster.

Port Forwarding and Exposing:  On port forwarding and exposing the Kubernetes application demonstrates  mastery of Kubernetes networking.
